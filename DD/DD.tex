\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
This document represents the Design Document (DD) for SmartParking mobile application. The purpose of this document is to provide an overall guidance to the architecture of the software product and the interaction between all the components of the system to be developed, following the requirements and the goals that the software must satisfy.

\subsection{Scope}
SmartParking is a crowd-sourced application where users can view all the street parkings around them, together with detailed information. Users can also filter the parkings in several ways: searching for a specific address, a specific type, a maximum distance, etc... Moreover, users can pay the fee directly from the app, chosing the payment type and how much they want to stop.

\section{Architectural Design}
Our application is composed by two main components: a Front End, developed with the React Native framework, and a Back End that relies on Firebase, and in particular on Firebase Realtime Database.\\
These two components are highly connected: in fact, the mobile application has the role to show to the user all the data stored in the Database, and also to respond to the user's behaviour.\\


\subsection{Front End: Mobile Application}
The Mobile Application is a React Native application composed by several screens, each one will be described in the User Interface Design Section. The choiche of React Native frameworks comes from the fact that, being SmartParking an application that will be mainly used "in real time", smartphones will be the target devices: it's more reasonable that a user is using his smartphone when driving (obviously respecting the street law code) rather than a tablet or a smartwatch. A \textbf{cross-platform} framework has been identified as the smartest choiche in this case, in order to reach the largest number of users.\\
This Application will obviously be a \textbf{multi-thread} application. This because we need to be able to handle all user actions and at the same time to keep the Google Map and the shown parkings updated, without having blocking instructions and so performing all the actions in parallel.\\
The Mobile Application is composed of a total of X screens (better described in Section Y), and the most important of these are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {Home/Map}
\item {Parkings}
\item {Profile}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Back End: Firebase}
The Firebase back end is where all the parkings, users and reservations data are stored. The back end is also encharged of authentication and user session management (a well implemented and tested functionality of Firebase). \\
The main data that has to be stored is the parking Area data: every city has some areas, and each of them includes a number of parking spots of different type: everything must be saved. \\
Since Firebase RD is a NoSQL Database we have a JSON-style structure, where we have 2 main folders: \textbf{Cities} and \textbf{Users}. 
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{db_general.png}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Cities} 
In this folder are stored all the Cities included in the project, and each of them contains all the parking Areas that will be shown to the user. 
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{db_area.png}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Users} 
In this folder are stored all the Users registered to SmartParking (by their ID), and each of them contains all the needed information about them such as e-mail, name, preferences, etc.. 
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{db_users.png}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Architectural styles and patterns}
\subsubsection{Design Patterns}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Model-View-Controller Pattern}: is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces which divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user. Following the MVC architectural pattern decouples these major components allowing for code reuse and parallel development. \\In SmartParking, we can say that the \texttt{Mobile App} represents both the \textbf{View} and the \textbf{Controller} of the system, while the entire \texttt{Back end} and in particular the Database represents the \textbf{Model}. That is, the App shows the relevant data to the user, and provide the possibility to choose between some options to modify the shown data: it behaves like a Controller, calling fetch methods to update the Server-side data. \\It is worth to mention that, in some cases, the MVC Pattern with a local copy on the client side has been used: this because relying on fetch methods everytime the user modifies some data would be too heavy from a computational point of view, and also too much internet-consuming.  

\item \texttt{Observer/Observable Pattern}: is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically. Observer pattern falls under behavioral pattern category. This is the natural Design Pattern used to implement the MVC Pattern: in our system, the intent of this pattern is to let the User execute some queries through the UI and after searching the Database, the result is shown back in the UI. If changes occurs in the database, the UI is notified and updates the UI. \\We can say that React Native helped us a lot in implementing this pattern, due to the intrinsic presence of this. All RN components, in fact, are "linked" to state values, and modifying them results in modifying also the UI to which the value is linked. 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{History Screen}
\subsection{Filter Screen}
\subsection{Profile Screen}

\section{Implementation and Integration}
We can split this section in three main phases, written in order of implementation: 

\subsection{Front End implementation}
First of all we created all the needed screens with a very basic design: we were focused on providing a good User eXperience flow first by identifying all the best components to insert, and only after this phase we started thinking about the color, shape and less-relevant details. This is a very common development flow in mobile applications, and works very well when managing a lot of screens and user flow possibilities.   
\subsection{Back End implementation}
We created the Back end skeleton of the system, by configuring Firebase Realtime Database in order to store every needed information. In particular, we started by organizing and adding all the involved Cities (in the very first version only Milan and Sondrio, the group members' cities), and then adding to them all the parking Areas. 
\subsection{Front End and Back End integration}
This phase was relatively short, because 

\section{Testing}
Nothing.

\section{Software System Attributes}

\subsection{Reliability}
The system guarantees a 24/7 service. Even if some Back end data has to change the system can be updated without downtimes, because every change in the Database will be immediately received and correctly updated from the Mobile Application.

\subsection{Availability}
The system is not used for critical services so the occurrence of faults is tolerated. However, given that the Mobile Application relies on safe and highly tested libraries and Third Party components and APIs, we can estimate the system availability to be at least at 99\%. 

\subsection{Security}
The only Security aspect that the system must handle is the credentials transmission and storage: Firebase does that, and obviously no password data is stored in the Database. Also for in-app payment, no sensible data is stored and Stripe/Paypal APIs provide a secure transmission of data.

\subsection{Compatibility}
The system will be hopefully used by a lot of people, so the Mobile Application must be compatible to as many devices as possible. Moreover, Hardware Limitations are not so tight because nowadays nearly every smartphone should satisfy them, making Compatibility easier to reach. In addition, nearly every smart device can run the application: every iOS or Android tablet and every iOS or Android smartphone.

\subsection{Scalability}
The architecture is simply scalable as the number of users grows during the time. Enlarging the structure of the system is be an easy task: Firebase helps us a lot in this case, because the number of possible users is huge and the parking Areas and Cities can be expanded in a really easy way, by simply adding them one after the other in the Database (also thanks to the NoSQL structure).
