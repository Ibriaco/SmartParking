# SmartParking
# Overview
SmartParking is a crowd-sourced application, where users can view all the street parkings
around them, together with detailed information. Users can also filter the parkings in
several ways: searching for a specific address, a specific type, a maximum distance, etc..
Moreover, users can pay the fee directly from the app, chosing the payment type and
how much they want to stop
# Front End
The Mobile Application is a React Native application composed by several screens, each
one will be described in the User Interface Design Section. The choice of React Native
frameworks comes from the fact that, being SmartParking an Application that will be
mainly used ”in real time”, smartphones will be the target devices: it’s more reasonable
that a user is using his smartphone when driving (obviously respecting the street law
code) rather than a tablet or a smartwatch. A <b>cross-platform</b> framework has been
identified as the smartest choice in this case, in order to reach the largest number of
users. <br/>
This Application is <b>multi-threaded</b> because we need to be able to
handle all user actions and at the same time to keep the Google Map and the shown
parkings updated, without having blocking instructions and so performing all the actions
in parallel. <br/>
The Mobile Application is composed of a total of 17 screens (including sub-screens)
(better described in Section 7), and the most important ones are:
* HomePage/Map
* Parkings
* Profile
# Back End
The Firebase back end is where all the parkings, users and reservations data are stored.
The back end is also encharged of authentication and user session management (a well
implemented and tested functionality of Firebase).
The main data that has to be stored is the parking Area data: every city has some areas,
and each of them includes a number of parking spots of different type: everything must
be saved.
Since Firebase RD is a NoSQL Database we have a JSON-style structure, where we have
2 main folders: <b>Cities</b> and <b>Users</b> <br/>
* <b>Cities</b> In this folder all the Cities included in the project are stored, and each of them
contains all the parking Areas that will be shown to the user
* <b>Users</b> In this folder all the Users registered to SmartParking are stored (by their
ID), and each contains all the needed information about them such as e-mail, name,
preferences, etc.. <br/>
# Design Patterns
* <b>Model-View-Controller Pattern</b>: a software design pattern commonly used for
developing user interfaces which divides the related application logic into three
interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.
Following the MVC architectural pattern decouples these major components allowing for code reuse and parallel development.
In SmartParking, we can say that the Mobile App represents both the View and
the Controller of the system, while the entire Back end and in particular the
Database represents the Model. That is, the App shows the relevant data to
the user, and provides the possibility to choose between some options to modify
the shown data: it behaves like a Controller, calling fetch methods to update the
Server-side data.
It is worth to mention that, in some cases, the MVC Pattern with a local copy
on the client side has been used: this because relying on fetch methods every-time
and considering that the user modifies only few data, it would be too heavy from
a computational point of view, and also very bandwidth-consuming.
* <b>Observer/Observable Pattern</b>: used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its dependent objects are to be
notified automatically. Observer pattern falls under Behavioral Pattern category.
This is the natural Design Pattern used to implement the MVC Pattern: in our
system, the intent of this pattern is to let the User execute some queries through
the UI and after searching the Database, the result is shown back in the UI. If
changes occurs in the database, the UI is notified and updates the UI.
We can say that React Native helped us a lot in implementing this pattern, due
to the intrinsic presence of this. All RN components, in fact, are ”linked” to state
values, and modifying them results in modifying also the UI to which the value is
linked.
# Third Party Integration
# Google
Considering the huge impact Google has as an IT company all over the World, and
that it has under its wing around 2 billion users, we wanted facilitate the access to
SmartParking’s functionalities. For this reason we integrated Google Authentication,
already provided by Firebase back end services
# Facebook
For the same reasons provided to Google Authentication, we integrated Facebook Authentication as well. <br/>
Such functionality is in fact already provided by Firebase back end
services
# PayPal
In order to handle PayPal payments, we had to set up a PayPal Developer account, and
also two different sandbox accounts (one Merchant and one Customer). Due to the lack
of documentation of React Native-PayPal libraries and components, we were forced to
implement the payment through a Webview and calls to bare PayPal APIs, using POST
fetch requests.
# Stripe
Stripe implementation in React Native is far from being cross-platform, and this is the
reason why we had to follow the same approach of PayPal implementation, using a
Webview to call the Stripe Checkout APIs and proceed to the payment.
