# SmartParking
# Overview
SmartParking is a crowd-sourced application, where users can view all the street parkings
around them, together with detailed information. Users can also filter the parkings in
several ways: searching for a specific address, a specific type, a maximum distance, etc..
Moreover, users can pay the fee directly from the app, chosing the payment type and
how much they want to stop
# Front End
The Mobile Application is a React Native application composed by several screens, each
one will be described in the User Interface Design Section. The choice of React Native
frameworks comes from the fact that, being SmartParking an Application that will be
mainly used ”in real time”, smartphones will be the target devices: it’s more reasonable
that a user is using his smartphone when driving (obviously respecting the street law
code) rather than a tablet or a smartwatch. A <b>cross-platform</b> framework has been
identified as the smartest choice in this case, in order to reach the largest number of
users. <br/>
This Application is <b>multi-threaded</b> because we need to be able to
handle all user actions and at the same time to keep the Google Map and the shown
parkings updated, without having blocking instructions and so performing all the actions
in parallel. <br/>
The Mobile Application is composed of a total of 17 screens (including sub-screens)
(better described in Section 7), and the most important ones are:
* HomePage/Map
* Parkings
* Profile
